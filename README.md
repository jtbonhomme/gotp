Golang secure storage for your 2FA secret from your terminal.

`gotp` has only been tested on Mac OS X (Mojave).
It requires specific installation to be used with `pass` on Linux.

# Context

Modern web services offer a 2-factor authentication as a complement of the traditional login/password method. This brings an additional security level, based on the Time-based One-Time Password (TOTP), because even if a user's traditional password is stolen or compromised, an attacker cannot gain access without the TOTP, which expires quickly.

A time-based one-time password (TOTP) is a temporary passcode generated by an algorithm that uses the current time of day as one of its authentication factors.

The TOTP specification (RFC-6238) describes the TOTP algorithm, as an time-based variant of the One-Time Password (OTP), namely the HMAC-based One-Time Password (HOTP)  algorithm.

The TOTP is basicaly a hash-mac token computed from a shared key (generaly randomky generated) and seed with a 30-second valid timestamp. Lot's of mobile applications can provide such a service (Google Authenticator, ...)

When you wish to log into a 2FA protected service, you are asked to provide your credentials (login/password) then to enter the TOTP displayed on the application.
The web service computed the same TOTP and make sure they are equal.

# Motivation

I started using this security feature long time ago, and was happy using the Google Authenticator application on my mobile phone. Until I realized I forgot to export all the secret keys I use every day at work on my new phone, and was unable to connect to AWS console for a day.

That day, I wish I had a backup solution on my laptop. Then I started to wonder how I could implement a desktop application with a secure storage backend.

# Usage

## Download

## Install as a command line tool

```sh
go get -u github.com/jtbonhomme/gotp/cmd/gotp
```

## Add a key

The shared secret shall be in the base-32 format.

```sh
gotp add -key=gmail -value=KZAUYVKFGA======
```

## Get a code

The code read is copied to the clipboard.

```
gotp get -key=AWS
code: 585146 (copied to clipboard)
```

## List all keys

```sh
gotp list
```

## Delete a key

```sh
gotp del -key=gmail
```

# The secure KeyChain

`gotp` uses the [keyring](https://godoc.org/github.com/99designs/keyring) library to store the
